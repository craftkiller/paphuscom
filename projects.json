If playing as Revere, their goal is to travel from town to town to spread the word of the impending arrival of the British. Meanwhile the British are attempting to prevent Revere from reaching those towns. The British are capable of fielding vastly superior numbers but must send any orders via messenger and must therefore make more large, sweeping movements. In addition, while both players know where towns are located, the British don't know the lay of the land the way Revere does and therefore cannot see terrain they have yet to explore while Revere can.",

I also set up a quick and dirty echo server to faciliate the acquision of the player’s public ip address, which is a necessary first step towards interactive gameplay. Also, I put in the particle effect smoke system to indicate the player’s health.",
